# Worklog

## 2026-07-21 — Initial StatePort Site foundation

- Created a standalone StateSpec-governed sibling repository for the public
  StatePort website.
- Established the factual boundary: the implementation repository is private,
  no public release or download is published, and the site must not present a
  future release as current availability.
- Added the static deployment shape, documentation/tutorial/release routes,
  and the accepted StatePort shell mascot copied byte-for-byte with recorded
  provenance.
- Ran `python3 scripts/validate_repo.py`: passed. The gate checks required
  StateSpec files, route and asset references, Pages workflow presence, and
  the no-private-source-link boundary.
- Completed local browser review at desktop and mobile widths, including the
  responsive menu, homepage, documentation page, and release page. No browser
  console errors were observed.
- Remote publication, Pages deployment, and human acceptance remain open at
  this point in the worklog.
